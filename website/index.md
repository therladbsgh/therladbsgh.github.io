I'm currently learning how to build websites from scratch.

Unfortunately, most of the time there are obstacles to building such websites. 
Firstly, I rarely get to finish building these websites in the first place. 
Secondly, the presence of Wordpress and Wix means that people are more inclined to use
those services instead of building one.

Still, though, I find many benefits in creating websites from scratch. First of all,
it's free (in terms of money, no guarantee for your time, of course.) I have not paid a
single penny making these sites, whereas most other services require a minimum of USD$10
or above monthly. (That was a lie. I did pay for the domain name, but for the grand price
of USD$0.99, which lasts for a year. Pretty nice deal.) Secondly, I have absolute, total 
control over what I want to do with this site, which is a privilege that is not as 
possible in other services.

Nonetheless, if I begin working on a site, I'll make sure to list them here. I would also 
like the opportunity to try out Wordpress sometime, if I were to overcome the 
problem of pricing.

##Q&A Site

Static sites are obviously easy to build (as was the case for this site.)
Dynamic sites are more time-consuming and esoteric; I'm learning Ruby on Rails at the 
moment and I wish I had a clue on what I was doing.

My plans for the Ruby on Rails application is to make a Q&A site, which can then
be used for various purposes. Perhaps to create a forum for discussion, perhaps to
make a tutoring site, etc. I will have to eventually figure out a way to let users be
able to make forum posts.

##Just Another Website

After making this site, I wanted to have some more practice with Github Pages (and
subsequently HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Jekyll.) The result was having to make another static
page website, which I named "Just Another Website" because there is not much meaning in
that site (the site has no purpose at the moment. It was just a subject of practice.)

The website has basic functionality: headers, footers, pages, blogs, media posts, etc. It
should serve well for most websites if people need them.

##Yet Another Website

To complete my trifecta of "Github Pages websites", I made yet another site, this time
dealing with "Single-page websites", as opposed to a blog-esque website (Word of Telefonmast)
and a "product website" (Just Another Website). As I do not have an immediate need for
this site either (other than experimenting), the site remains content-free.

The page consists of only one page (obviously), and is divided into sections which one
can navigate through the header. Sections are fully customizable; one can put in a section
or remove a section or edit a section to their liking. Each section has its own content,
from text to images to portfolios.
