##Q&A Site (Work in progress)

Static sites are obviously easy to build (as was the case for this site.)
Dynamic sites are a bit more time-consuming and complicated, as they require not only 
front-end development, but also back-end development (dealing with databases and servers.)
This site is developed using Ruby on Rails, which I am learning concurrently.

My plans for the Ruby on Rails application is to make a Q&A site, which can then
be used for various purposes: perhaps to create a forum for discussion, perhaps to
make a tutoring site, etc. I will have to eventually figure out a way to let users be
able to make forum posts.

##Just Another Website

After making this site, I wanted to have some more practice with Github Pages (and
subsequently HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Jekyll.) The result was having to make another static
page website, which I named "Just Another Website" because it is a barebones
site (the site has no purpose at the moment. It was just a subject of practice.)

The website has basic functionality: headers, footers, pages, blogs, media posts, etc.

##Yet Another Website

To complete my trifecta of "Github Pages websites", I made yet another site, this time
dealing with "Single-page websites", as opposed to a "blog-esque website" (this site)
and a "product website" (Just Another Website). As I do not have an immediate need for
this site either (other than experimenting and practice), the site remains content-free.

The page consists of only one page, and is divided into sections which one
can navigate through the header. Sections are fully customizable; one can put in a section
or remove a section or edit a section to their liking. Each section has its own content,
from text to images to portfolios.

##HKIS PFO Chinese New Year Store

There was a request from the PFO (Parent Faculty Organization) to help create an
"e-commerce website" to sell apparel for the 2016 Chinese New Year. The site is simply
an online means to buy school uniform (shirts, jackets, etc.) 

As this is a perfect example of a dynamic site (involving databases for user accounts,
products, payments, site configurations, etc.) the knowledge from Ruby on Rails came in
handy even though the site itself didn't use Ruby on Rails (the concepts and knowledge
for databases are the same regardless of the language.) Here I put theoretical practice
to use and made something remotely useful.

##HKIS Talent

Here is a shameless plug for HKIS Talent, a site highlighting the talents of
HKIS students, teachers, faculty and alumni, from highly-acclaimed talents such as music
and art to esoteric talents such as juggling. Not many people know of other people's
talents in school, and so the site aims to change that. 

Being an editor and part of the HKIS Talent Team means two big things. First, I am able to
do something useful and helpful in the school community. Second, I finally have a means to 
learn Wordpress at a more significant level.
