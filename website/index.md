I'm currently learning how to build websites from scratch.

Unfortunately, most of the time there are obstacles to building such websites. 
Firstly, I rarely get to finish building these websites in the first place. 
Secondly, the presence of Wordpress and Wix means that people are more inclined to use
those services instead of building one.

Still, though, I find many benefits in creating websites from scratch. First of all,
it's free (in terms of money, no guarantee for your time, of course.) I have not paid a
single penny making these sites, whereas most other services require a minimum of USD$10
or above monthly. Secondly, I have absolute, total control over what I want to do with
this site, which is a privilege that is not as possible in other services.

Nonetheless, if I begin working on a site, I'll make sure to list them here. I would also 
like the opportunity to try out Wordpress sometime, if I were to overcome the 
problem of pricing.

##Q&A Site

Static sites are obviously easy to build (as was the case for this site.)
Dynamic sites are more time-consuming and esoteric; I'm learning Ruby on Rails at the 
moment and I wish I had a clue on what I was doing.

My plans for the Ruby on Rails application is to make a Q&A site, which can then
be used for various purposes. Perhaps to create a forum for discussion, perhaps to
make a tutoring site, etc. I will have to eventually figure out a way to let users be
able to make forum posts.

##Just Another Website

After making this site, I wanted to have some more practice with Github Pages (and
subsequently HTML, CSS, SCSS, and Jekyll.) The result was having to make another static
page website, which I named "Just Another Website" because there is not much meaning in
that site (the site has no purpose at the moment. It was just a subject of practice.)

The website has basic functionality: headers, footers, pages, blogs, media posts, etc. It
should serve well for most websites if people need them.
