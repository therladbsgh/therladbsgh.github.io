    I am a second year undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Cognitive Science at
    Brown University.

<p>
    Currently I'm engaging myself in various areas within computer science. I'm learning the specifics of artificial intelligence in my current courses; I've learned full-stack web development and data analysis through past internships; I'm learning current frameworks and technologies through hackathons and personal projects.
