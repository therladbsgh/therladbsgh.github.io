**Banditlike** is a simple roguelike game designed to test 2D game development.

Banditlike serves as both a 2D game and a means to test out new programming concepts
or features for 2D games (such as adding field of view, a third dimension, monsters, 
items, et cetera.)

Banditlike (or parts of it) may be used or incorporated to other games, such as Economist 
(which may change from text-based to a full-fledged 2D world, with markets and banks 
to travel to or whatever) or room-escape games.

This game was created in Java, using
