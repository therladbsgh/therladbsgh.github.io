I'm currently learning how to build and design games.

I have always wanted to make games since I was young, and have sought methods to create 
games, one of which is programming. However, if there is one thing that I have learned 
from game design and development, it is that 
tackling video game development (and other large challenges) involves a lot more than 
just programming. I mean sure, you kind of need a programmer to make a video game, but 
to make a *palatable* video game, you are going to then need planning, art design, sound 
design, marketing, et cetera. Indeed, game design is a task that requires knowledge in 
pretty much all fields. 

Considering the plethora of game-development tools that exist today (Game Maker Studio
for 2D games, and Unity / Unreal / Source engine for 3D games), and the success of
video games from these tools (one that comes to mind is *Undertale*, which uses the
simple Game Maker Studio to create an impactful video game), I realize that in the
current world today, *game design* appears a lot more important than simple *game
development*. As a result, I am currently learning how to use the tools mentioned above,
which should be a good means to create video games more effectively in the future.

Regardless, that does not mean creating video games from scratch is entirely neglected,
since they do provide a good means of practice and learning for programming and concepts
for Computer Science. Here is a list of such games that I am currently making, or have
made.
