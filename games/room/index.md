**Room** is a game engine designed to create room-escape games (or any text-based
adventure game) more easily, and with flexibility.

**Room** provides all the basic commands necessary in any text-adventure game, such as
movement, inspection, inventory, item interactions, etc. If necessary, custom commands 
or room-specific commands can be implemented for any room as well (if the room requires
you to fly or swim or do some other unconventional action, you can add that with
relative ease.)

Possible next steps may include making the files modular (for example, separating
items, rooms, etc. into different files.)
