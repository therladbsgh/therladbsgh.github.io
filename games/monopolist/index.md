**Monopolist** is the natural next step of the Monopoly board game, a game that relies 
far more on actual skill than the mere whims of the RNG and actually relies on some 
understanding of economics.

A game of monopolist begins with a board that is visually similar to the monopoly one. 
It contains tiles along the edges, with 10 along each edges summing up to 36 total tiles. 
Each side of the board constitutes a sector of the world. One for residential, one for 
commercial, one for financial and one for political. Players move across the tiles in 
sequential order through dice rolls, with the dice determining distance traveled.

Similar to standard monopoly, one way to win is to ensure that all other players go 
bankrupt. However, this is difficult to achieve due to the fact that this is not a 
zero-sum game. Players earn salary that expands the monetary pool, at a rate where 
the inflation makes it realistic for all players to stay “in the game”. While there 
are no systematic or automatic anti-snowballing measures, there are methods to take 
out frontrunners.

This leads to the alternate win condition, a political victory. The political victory is 
achieved when complete control of the White House is established, which requires both 
large amounts of money and some amount of political power. 

Each sector of the world (side of the board) has a unique purpose in leading to victory. 
The residential sector primarily serves as a source of labor and a minor income 
generator. The commercial sector is the primary means of earning money. The financial 
sector is a secondary means of earning money, but can dramatically change how money is 
used and spent in the game. The political sector is a way of influencing rules and policy 
to best benefit the player.

**Monopolist** is currently intended to be multiplayer-only, with 3D graphics (which shouldn't
be too difficult, since it is a board game.)

The game is a Senior Project (an in-school project where seniors can decide
to do pretty much anything), which means that I am currently working on this with a team,
with each person having a specialized role (separating the roles of server development,
client development, artwork, soundwork, etc.)
