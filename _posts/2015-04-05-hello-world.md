Hello world.

This is my first post. Hooray for Github Pages, now I don't have to pay $100 using Wordpress and still have the full customization and flexibility (to an extent. No dynamic pages is a terrible thing. Wordpress doesn't really seem to offer that either, though.)

The purpose of this site is to list my work (if I ever get around to finishing something), ramblings, etc as I go along.

There is still a lot to sort in this website. Click on the side tab on the top left corner to go explore my remaining 2 pages in this site.
