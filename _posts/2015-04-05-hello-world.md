Hello world.

Firstly, hooray for Github Pages, because now I don't have to pay 
$100 using Wordpress and still have the full customization and flexibility (to an extent. 
No dynamic pages is a terrible thing. Wordpress doesn't really seem to offer that 
either, though.)

The purpose of this site is to list my work (if I get around to finishing something), 
ramblings, etc as I go along.

Click on the side tab on the top left 
corner to go explore my random works in this site.
