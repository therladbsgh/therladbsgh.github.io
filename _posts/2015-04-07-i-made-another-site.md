After making this site, I was motivated to make more, so I did.

<div markdown="0"><a href="/just-another-website/" target="_blank" class="btn">Just Another Website</a></div>

Although I wanted to make another site, I did not have a use for another site, so
currently the site is just sitting there with no use (other than to look pretty.) If
I or someone else finds a use for that site, I'll edit the site accordingly.

Unlike this site, which has a quasi-blog format with additional random pages, I wanted
to make an actual "site" that a service, product, or organization might use. The site 
pretty much includes everything that may be needed: headers/footers, a showcase page,
etc. Obviously, since the site is hosted through Github Pages, it does not have any
dynamic features, but most sites don't need that anyway (also things like Disqus and
Google forms can work as substitutes.)

Sometime this week I'll make another site through Github Pages, this time experimenting
on one of those "single-page sites" that have been popping up recently.
