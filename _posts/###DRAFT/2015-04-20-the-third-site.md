As promised, I went ahead and set up a third website, this time focusing and experimenting
on a "single-page website".

<div markdown="0"><a href="http://therladbsgh.github.io/yet-another-website/" target="_blank" class="btn">Yet Another Website</a></div>

Just like "Just Another Website", as the purpose of the site is simply to provide exercise
for web development skills, the site remains empty in content until I find a use for it.

Single page websites show everything in one page, and you navigate through the tabs
on the header. Each "section" of the page shows different information; in this case,
there is a "Getting Started" section, a mock portfolio, an "About" section, and a contact
section. If need be, I can add more sections with relative ease.

As usual, the site was made to practice HTML, CSS, and Jekyll, and since this page is 
hosted through Github Pages, there is no dynamic content (although you can, again, put SaaS
content such as Disqus or Google forms.)

This site completes my trifecta of Github Pages websites. I'll probably be working on
either dynamic sites (the "Q&A Site...") or on desktop applications for a while now,
although I'll continue making static sites every now and then if I ever feel like it.
