**Economist** is a work in progress game to simulate the real world economy.

## Introduction

Most other games have an economy system in place to encourage trading, but is not the 
main point of their game; oftentimes, an economy system exists for players to simply 
have easier access to certain goods, such as weapons, so that they have the necessary 
means to complete the main objective (battling others, surviving, etc.)

**Economist**, unlike the majority of other games, serves to simply bring the economy as 
the greatest aspect. Survival and going into dungeons would be secondary goals in the 
game, but the primary goal would be to accumulate as much wealth as possible, and become 
the wealthiest in the game. Those who have a lot of money can then spend money on 
amenities, such as goods that would otherwise require paid in real life money, organizing 
events, prestige, et cetera.

Currently the game is text-based, and is singleplayer. The game is currently in
singleplayer simply because it is easier to build it that way, but the game really should
be in multiplayer so players can trade in real time and a proper market can form, so I
will get around to working on a multiplayer version (building a server and client.) If
I get a graphic artist, or have the time myself, I will have to make a GUI for it as
well.
