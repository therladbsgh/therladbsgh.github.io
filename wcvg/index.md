Welcome to The Wanderings and Contemplations of Video Games.

The Wanderings and Contemplations of Video Games is a series in 
which I will analyse and comment on various aspects of video games, whether that be on 
narrative, graphics, sound, thematic concepts, mechanics, or anything for that matter. 

I see a lot of people around me enjoy video games, which is a great thing, of course. 
Even a few years ago, video games were mostly considered a niche interest and an 
unproductive waste of time. And while some today may still consider it an unproductive 
use of time, the medium is now undeniably far more widespread today, encompassing age 
and gender.

Still, however, I find something missing amidst all this, and that would be the use of 
video games as a medium greater than the sole purpose of entertainment. Sure, the term 
"game" itself implies entertainment, but video games have a variety of properties that 
provide an advantage over other mediums. They can provide narrative in second-person. 
They can give players a tangible and therefore more impactful experience. They allow 
players to collaborate and interact with not just the game itself, but with others.

I will often talk about anything that comes to my mind, but it is my hope that through 
The Wanderings and Contemplations of Video Games, you will ultimately be able to learn 
how video games can be utilised to provide a meaningful impact to the audience, and 
consequently gain a greater sense of appreciation of what video games can offer.

The Wanderings and Contemplations of Video Games will be written discourse discussing
the topics of games and their significance. If time and opportunity permits, I may turn
these into podcasts or video essays or something.
