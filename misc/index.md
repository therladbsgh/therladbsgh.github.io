Here lies a bunch of random stuff, for future needs.

##Geometry Calculator

A calculator from long, long ago, back when I had to learn geometry. This is a simple
program made in Applescript (a simple scripting program that provides a convenient
GUI) that calculates the distance between a point to a line, the distance between two 
parallel or perpendicular lines, and the distance between two points.

##Insanity Machine

A simple program made in Applescript, that (as the name implies) will drive the person
(who opens the application) insane. Creates an incessant dinging sound. Use at your
own discretion.

##Spam Game

A short game, made in (again) Applescript. Designed to test permanent variables that
is stored across program start and termination.

##Skript

A series of server-side modifications for Minecraft, designed to add classes and class
features to the game.
